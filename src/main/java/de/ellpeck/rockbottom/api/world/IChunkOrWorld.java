/**
 * This class represents a chunk or world. It is special due to two classes
 * extending it that have slightly different behavior. As such, whenever the
 * word {@code world} is mentioned in the documentation of this class, it can
 * also refer to the {@code chunk} that is being accessed when callilng this
 * method. As such, some behavior might be different or unexpected and it might
 * cause crashes if you're not careful with how you use this class.
 * <p>
 * For instance, calling {@link #getState(int, int)} in an {@link IWorld} will
 * always return a valid {@link TileState}, however, calling the same method for
 * an {@link IChunk} will cause a crash if the position is outside of the
 * chunk's boundaries, as calling it from a chunk will still result in
 * world-level coordinates being used. For that reason, {@link IChunk} provides
 * a mulitude of methods like {@link IChunk#getStateInner(int, int)} that will
 * allow you to get properties of a chunk without needing to know its position
 * within the world.
 * <p>
 * To access the game's current world object, use {@link
 * IGameInstance#getWorld()}. See {@link IWorld} and {@link IChunk} for greater
 * documentation on the seperate behavior of chunks and worlds.
