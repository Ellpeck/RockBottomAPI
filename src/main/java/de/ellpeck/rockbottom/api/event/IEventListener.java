     * listeners that are in the queue before this one returning a different
     * {@link EventResult} in their {@code listen} method. Generally, if you

     * process, meaning the queue of listeners will be cleared so that listeners
     * later in the queue will not listen to this event.
     *
     * @param result The event result of the previous listener. This should be
     *               passed on if the event's result should not be changed
     * @param event  The actual event instance that can be checked or modified.
     *               Generally speaking, if an event has parameters that are
     *               {@code non-final}, they can be changed by the event
     *               listener to change the outcome of the event.
     * @return The result passed into this method if unchanged, else the
     * corresponding event result
