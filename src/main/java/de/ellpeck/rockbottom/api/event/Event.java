/**
 * This is the basic class for any kind of event that can be handled and fired
 * using the {@link IEventHandler}.
 * <p>
 * Generally speaking, an event class' variables should all be public and either
 * final or non-final, based on if they should be modifyable or not.
 * <p>
 * As an example of this behavior, the {@link BreakEvent} has a final {@link
 * AbstractEntityPlayer} parameter, as the player that is breaking a tile should
 * not be changed. However, the positions and wether or not the breaking
 * operation was offective are non-final, meaning an event listener is able to
 * change which position a tile is being broken at and wether or not it should
 * drop its item.
 * <p>
 * Keep in mind that, when creating a custom event, you should always query any
 * non-final variables that you pass into the event after firing it to ensure
 * that the outcome of the event actually influences the outcome of your
 * operation.
